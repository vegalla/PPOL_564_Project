|    Phase Three remained highly important in estimating the level of community mobility. The increasing Phases generally represent a time moving forward, and unfortunately, while Phase One and Two were periods of 3-4 weeks, Phase Three has been an indefinite period since July, covering five months. The variable Phase Three is associated with mobility returning the pre-pandemic levels as individuals and communities normalize recreational activities with waning fears of the virus thanks to regular behavior of mask-wearing. A random scramble of this variable throughout the timeframe causes the greatest error in algorithms.
|    Throughout all Models, support for President Trump remained an important feature in predicting community mobility corroborating the findings of Perry, Whitehead, and Grubbs. The anti-science rhetoric embedded in political conservatism that defies precautionary behavior cannot be randomly scrambled without greatly increasing error in the algorithms.
|    Median income also greatly affects error when randomly scrambled. Income’s importance may reflect the difference in how COVID-19 affected different income levels. At a county level, higher income may represent urbanization and greater job security against the pandemic. Lower income counties then would be more rural, relying on labor in which COVID-19 had disastrous repercussions on employment. Overall, higher income counties indicate greater access to recreational facilities as well as the means to enjoy them more frequently. Scrambling income across the counties causes error, though not at the same magnitude as Phase Three or support for Trump.
|    The feature of interest in my exploration had been COVID-19, and from predicting the level of community mobility, the weekly net increase of COVID-19 cases or deaths consistently placed as a minimally important feature. This indicates that a random scramble of this data had minimal effect in reducing error within the algorithm, and therefore does not predict the level of frequency communities visit recreational facilities well. However, in Model 4 the number of weekly net change of coronavirus cases was the most important feature with a comparable MSE to Model 1, 49.29 and 46.93 respectively. These values cannot be directly compared as the scale of predicted error varies due to different dependent variables. For comparison, the daily rate of change averaged at 0.017 (median of 0), while the level averaged at-15.171 (median of -13). Due to the differences, I interpret the error of Model 4 to be in greater magnitude than Model 1 despite being in a similar range of MSE values.
|    An ideal finding would have been high importance of this variable with the belief that increasing coronavirus statistics would warrant reduced mobility to recreational facilities. The lack of importance in Models 1-3 signals that communities, or at least the individuals willing who frequent engage in recreational behavior, are immune to the escalating coronavirus numbers surrounding them. While Model 4 found coronavirus cases to be important in predicting the rate of change, I believe the predictions oversimplified the relationship and cannot be used to infer the effects of COVID-19.

|    As a small consideration, precipitation’s lack of importance in Model 2 contrasted heavily with my expectation of importance. I would have expected weather conditions, such as rain, to deter recreational behavior; however, that does not seem true in this model. As it is incredibly contrary to my expectations, I question if there is fault in the methodology of this analysis.
